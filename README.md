# This is my assignment for the cloud computing and using the amazon services to verify my login credentals using dynamo db , s3 bucket for storing the images from the image url , and the EC2 for hosting my website onto the aws management console . Also i have used lambda and api gateway for configuring my login details and dashboards. main goal was to create a serverless website.
